Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
The big thing it effects is if you should make functions public or private, which I am excited to keep learning about.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
It helped me a lot to draw a picture before starting the assignment, and I definetly would recomend that. I also did not debug until the end, which I definetly would NOT recomend - use the main in each class to debug.
